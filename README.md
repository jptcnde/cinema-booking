### Installation

npm install or yarn
```

### Development
```
npm start
```
This will start a local server for api and react  web application

### Production Build
```
npm run build
```

### Getting Started

As per specs, the application no need for authentication, because of that I only
create an avatar action that will be able to choose which email address (user). Email
address should be valid as the application will send an email confirmation upon booking a seat.
